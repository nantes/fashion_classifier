# Image Classifier with Fashion-MNIST and Keras

This project implements a simple neural network using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset. Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images, consisting of 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from one of 10 classes.

## Project Description

The main goal of this project is to build and train a neural network model capable of correctly classifying images of clothing items into 10 different categories. It serves as an introductory example to the world of image classification and the use of Keras.

## Dataset

The **Fashion-MNIST** dataset is used, which is a direct replacement for the original MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. The 10 classes are:

| Label | Description |
| :---: | :---------- |
|   0   | T-shirt/top |
|   1   | Trouser     |
|   2   | Pullover    |
|   3   | Dress       |
|   4   | Coat        |
|   5   | Sandal      |
|   6   | Shirt       |
|   7   | Sneaker     |
|   8   | Bag         |
|   9   | Ankle boot  |

The dataset is loaded directly via the Keras API: `tensorflow.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist`.

## Model Architecture

The model is a simple sequential neural network with the following architecture:

1.  **Flatten Layer (Implicit/Reshape)**: Transforms the 28x28 pixel images into a vector of 784 pixels.
    * In the current script, this is done with `train_images.reshape((60000, 28 * 28))` and `test_images.reshape((10000, 28 * 28))`. Alternatively, a `layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28))` layer could be used as the first layer of the model.
2.  **Dense Layer (Hidden)**: 128 neurons with ReLU activation function (`relu`).
    * `layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(28 * 28,))`
3.  **Dense Layer (Output)**: 10 neurons (one for each class) with Softmax activation function (`softmax`).
    * `layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')`

**Model Compilation:**
* **Optimizer**: `adam`
* **Loss Function**: `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` (suitable for integer labels)
* **Metrics**: `accuracy`

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need Python 3 installed, along with the following libraries:

* TensorFlow (`tensorflow`)
* Matplotlib (`matplotlib`)
* NumPy (`numpy`)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy

Installation and Usage
Clone the repository (or download the files):

# If you have a GitHub repository
# git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git)
# cd YOUR_REPOSITORY

If you only have the script, save it as fashion_classifier.py (or your preferred name).

Run the Python script:

python fashion_classifier.py

The script will load the dataset, preprocess the data, build, compile, and train the model. Finally, it will evaluate the model on the test set and display the accuracy and some visualized predictions.

Code Structure
The fashion_classifier.py script (or as you named it) follows these main steps:

Import libraries: Loads TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, and NumPy.

Load dataset: Gets Fashion-MNIST.

Data preprocessing: Normalizes pixel values and flattens images.

Model building: Defines the neural network architecture.

Model compilation: Sets up the optimizer, loss function, and metrics.

Model training: Fits the model to the training data.

Model evaluation: Measures performance on the test set.

Making and visualizing predictions: Shows how the model classifies some images.

Results
After training (by default, 10 epochs), the model should achieve an accuracy on the test set of approximately 85-89%. The exact results may vary slightly due to the random initialization of weights and the optimization process.

--- Training the model ---
... (training output) ...
--- Evaluating the model ---
Test accuracy: 0.8XXX  # Replace with your obtained accuracy
Test loss: 0.YYYY    # Replace with your obtained loss

(Optional: You can include a screenshot of the prediction visualizations or training/validation loss/accuracy plots here if you generate and save them).

Potential Improvements
This project is a baseline. Here are some ideas to expand and improve it:

Try different network architectures:

Add more dense layers.

Vary the number of neurons per layer.

Experiment with different activation functions.

Use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs typically offer significantly better performance on computer vision tasks.

Hyperparameter Tuning:

Try different optimizers (e.g., SGD, RMSprop).

Adjust the learning rate.

Experiment with different batch sizes and number of epochs.

Regularization: Add techniques like Dropout or L1/L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.

Data Augmentation: Generate more training data from existing data (rotations, translations, etc.) to improve model generalization.

Save and Load Model: Implement functionality to save the trained model and load it later for predictions without retraining.

Advanced Visualizations: Plot training and validation loss and accuracy over epochs.
